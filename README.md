# My D3.js Experiments

This project was created as a product of my d3.js library studying. I wanted to learn something more about creating charts and presenting data. I have created three kinds of charts. 
 - bar chart which shows which user used which letter and how often
- pie chart which shows the summary of all letters for both users
- bubble chart that shows which letter was used the most ( counts are the summary of both users )

Let's check it on :
